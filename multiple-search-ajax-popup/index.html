                <h2>Installation by WordPress</h2>
                <p>After downloading your package, please refrain from loading the entire package before extracting the file. The package is in ZIP format, and you can use an application or program for unpacking it (such as 7zip, WinRAR, WinZip, or others).</p>
                <p>Once you've extracted the file, navigate to the resulting folder and look for a subfolder named 'plugin.' Inside this folder, you will find a file with the same name as the plugin you intend to install. This file is also in ZIP format and needs to be installed on your WordPress site.</p>
                <p>To complete the installation, follow these steps:</p>
                <ol>
                    <li>Log in to your WordPress website.</li>
                    <li>Go to the 'Plugins' page in the WordPress Admin Panel.</li>
                    <li>Select 'Add New Plugin.'</li>
                    <li>On the plugin upload page, click on the 'Upload Plugin' button (or a similar option depending on your WordPress version).</li>
                    <li>Browse for and select the ZIP file of the plugin you previously extracted.</li>
                    <li>Click 'Install Now' and follow the instructions to activate the plugin on your WordPress site.</li>
                </ol>
                <p>Please remember that plugin installation is a crucial step in managing your website, so follow these instructions carefully to ensure a successful integration.</p>
            
                <h2>Installation by FTP</h2>
                <p><strong>Step 1: Preparation</strong></p>
                <p>Before you begin, make sure you have the ZIP file of the plugin you want to install on hand and unzipped. You will also need an FTP client such as FileZilla.</p>
            
                <p><strong>Step 2: Connect to Your Server via FTP</strong></p>
                <p>Start the FTP client (for example, FileZilla). Connect to your WordPress site's server using your FTP credentials (you'll usually find this information in your hosting provider's control panel).</p>
            
                <p><strong>Step 3: Navigate to the Plugins Folder</strong></p>
                <p>After connecting successfully, you will see a folder structure of your website on the right side of the FTP client. Navigate to the folder where WordPress is installed. This is usually done by going to the "public_html" folder or your website's root directory. Inside that folder, find the subfolder called "wp-content" and click to open it.</p>
            
                <p><strong>Step 4: Find the Plugins Folder</strong></p>
                <p>Inside the "wp-content" folder, you'll find a folder called "plugins." Click to access it.</p>
            
                <p><strong>Step 5: Upload the Plugin via FTP</strong></p>
                <p>On the left side of the FTP client, navigate to the folder where you unzipped the plugin file on your computer. Select all files and folders from the unzipped plugin. Drag these files and folders to the "plugins" folder in the FTP client (right side).</p>
            
                <p><strong>Step 6: Activate the Plugin in WordPress</strong></p>
                <p>After the files have been successfully transferred, access your WordPress site's admin panel. Go to the "Plugins" section in the menu. You should see the plugin you just downloaded listed among the available plugins. Click "Activate" under the plugin name.</p>
            
                <p><strong>Step 7: Configure the Plugin</strong></p>

            <section id="section3" class="section">
                <h2>Configuration</h2>
                <p>Our plugin offers a simplified setup. It's easy to customize every section, from header to footer. In each section, you can choose the type of content you want to display. Furthermore, the plugin integrates perfectly with WooCommerce, making it possible to purchase products directly through it.</p>
                <img src="assets/img/img-01.png" width="1080" height="860" alt="image" class="img-center"/>                
            </section>
            <div class="divider"></div>
            <section id="section4" class="section">
                <h2>Popup General</h2>                
                <p>In the general settings, it is the starting point for customizing your plugin. Here, you can choose the color style for the popup preload, adjust the background transparency, and enable special features. The "Smart Images" option stands out, which allows the plugin to automatically generate images in the appropriate size for display in search results cards. You can also choose from the image sizes already available in your WordPress.</p>
                <p>Two items deserve your special attention in this section. The first is the option to activate or deactivate the plugin, as illustrated in the image below:</p>
                <img src="assets/img/img-02.png" width="1080" height="618" alt="image" class="img-center"/>
                <p>The second crucial point is identifying your website's search form. You must provide a unique class of the form or the form ID, if available. If you don't know how to obtain this information, follow the steps below:</p>
                <h2>Step by step to identify the search form</h2>
                <p><strong>Step 1: Open the Web Page</strong></p>
                <p>Open the web page where the form is located using the browser of your choice.</p>
                <p><strong>Step 2: Open the Inspection Tools</strong></p>
                <p>Right-click the form or any element next to it and select "Inspect" or "Inspect Element" from the context menu. You can also press Ctrl + Shift + I (Windows/Linux) or Cmd + Opt + I (Mac) to open the inspection tool.</p>
                <p><strong>Step 3: Navigate to the Form</strong></p>
                <p>In the inspection tool, you will see a split window, with the HTML code on the left and the visual representation on the right. Use the selection arrow (usually called "Selector") on the top bar of the inspect tool and click on the form you want to inspect. As you hover over elements in the code, the corresponding form on the page should be highlighted.</p>
                <p><strong>Step 4: Identify the Class or Form ID</strong></p>
                <p>Look for the &lt;form&gt; tag in the HTML code. If the form has an ID, it will usually be listed as an attribute called id. Otherwise, look for an attribute called class. If there are multiple classes, choose one that is unique and exclusive to the form. If there is an ID, prefer to use the ID.</p>
                <p><em>Example with class:</em></p>
                <code>&lt;form class="your-class-here"&gt; Form content &lt;/form&gt;</code>
                <p><em>Example with ID:</em></p>
                <code>&lt;form id="your-id-here"&gt; Form content &lt;/form&gt;</code>
                <p><strong>Step 5: Configure your WordPress Plugin</strong></p>
                <p>With the form class or ID in hand, go to your WordPress plugin settings and find the field where you should enter the class or ID. For classes, enter the class name with a period in front (for example, .your-class-here). For IDs, enter the ID with a hash in front (e.g. #your-id-here).</p>
                <p><strong>Step 6: Save and Test</strong></p>
                <p>After entering the class or ID, save your plugin settings. Then go to the page or form where the plugin is active and test to ensure it is working as expected.</p>

                <p>In this section, you can customize the color scheme for the header of your popup. This feature is valuable for ensuring that the popup's visual appearance aligns with the overall visual identity of your site.</p>
                <p>You have the flexibility to enable or disable this feature. When disabled, the default colors and styles of the plugin will be automatically applied, ensuring a consistent visual experience.</p>

                <p>The footer section of the popup offers an interesting area where you can display menus containing links that are important to your users. However, if you consider it not necessary, you can disable it.</p>
                <p>The menus displayed in the footer must be previously created using the standard WordPress menus feature. After creating them, you can select them in the popup footer settings.</p>
                <p>Also, in this section, you have the option to customize the color style for your popup footer. This functionality is valuable for ensuring that the popup's appearance is aligned with your site's overall visual identity.</p>

                <p>If you are having trouble accessing the configuration options of your plugin or if it has stopped working, displaying messages like "Please activate the plugin license to access all features" in the administrative area of your WordPress, it means that you need to activate the plugin license.</p>
                <p>Attention: The following procedure applies to all our plugins. To activate the plugin license, follow the steps below:</p>
                <ol>
                    <li>
                        <p>Access your account page on the ExpandUP website and go to the "Application Password" tab. Create a password and store it securely, as it will be displayed only once. If you lose it, you will need to generate a new password for future activations.</p>
